    "# Weekly Homework 6: Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Goals of this homework:***\n",
    "* Understand why clustering is used in unsupervised learning.\n",
    "* Apply and compare k-means and DBSCAN.\n",
    "* Recognize strengths/weaknesses of each method based on data shape, density, and noise.\n",
    "* Choose parameters appropriately.\n",
    "* Evaluate clustering quality using quantitative metrics rather than visuals alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Submission instructions:***\n",
    "\n",
    "You should post your notebook to Canvas (look for the assignment there). Please name your submission **your-uin_hw6.ipynb**, so for example, my submission would be something like **555001234_hw6.ipynb**. Your notebook should be fully executed when you submit ... so run all the cells for us so we can see the output, then submit that.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Grading philosophy:***\n",
    "\n",
    "We are grading reasoning, judgment, and clarity, not just correctness. Show us that you understand the data, the constraints, and the limits of your conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "***For each question, you need to respond with 2 cells:***\n",
    "1. **[A Code Cell] Your Code:**\n",
    "  - If code is not applicable for the question, you can skip this cell.\n",
    "  - For tests: tests can be simple assertions or checks (e.g., using `assert` or `print` or small functions or visual inspection); formal testing frameworks are not required.\n",
    "2. **[A Markdown Cell] Your Answer:** Write up your answers and explain them in complete sentences. Include any videos in this section as well; for videos, upload them to your TAMU Google Drive, and ensure they are set to be visible by the instruction team (set to: **anyone with a TAMU email can view**), then share the link to the video in the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "***At the end of each Section (A/B/C/...) include a cell for your resources:***\n",
    "\n",
    "**[A Markdown Cell] Your Resources:** You need to cite 3 types of resources and note how they helped you: (1) Collaborators, (2) Web Sources (e.g. StackOverflow), and (3) AI Tools (you must also describe how you prompted, but we do not require any links to any specific chats). Specifically, use the following format as a template:\n",
    "```\n",
    "On my honor, I declare the following resources:\n",
    "1. Collaborators:\n",
    "- Reveille A.: Helped me understand that a df in pandas is a data structure kinda like a CSV.\n",
    "- Sully A.: Helped me fix a bug with the vector addition of 2 columns.\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Web Sources:\n",
    "- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46562479/python-pandas-data-frame-creation: how to create a pd df\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "3. AI Tools:\n",
    "- ChatGPT: I gave it the homework .ipynb file and the ufo.csv, and told it to generate the code for the first question, but it did it with csv.reader(), so I re-prompted it to use pandas and that one was correct\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "***Why do we require this cell?*** This cell is important...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For academic integrity, you must give credit where credit is due.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We want you to pay attention to how you can successfully get help to move through problems! Is there someone you work with or an AI tool that helps you learn the material better? That's great! The point of engineering is to use your tools to solve hard problems, and part of graduate school is learning about how *you* learn and solve problems best.\n",
    "\n",
    "***A reminder: you get out of it what you put into it.***\n",
    "Do your best on these homeworks, show us your creativity, and ask for help when you need it -- good luck!"

    "I performed very basic string processing: converted to lowercase to ensure a word like aArDvArk == aardvark, e.g the case of a word usually doesn't have much to do with its semantic meaning. I also removed any characters which weren't a-z as they too should not change the semantic meaning of the text. I then removed Stop words which are high frequency words that don't hold a lot of semantic weight, like \"the\". Finally I did lemmatization, which is essentially converting synonyms to the same base word. E.g better becomes \"good\". I think these choices help because they filter out words that don't contribute to the semantic meaning of the text, which helps reduce noise, and also aggregates similar words together which allows for easier analysis since there aren't as many unique tokens."

    "# Weekly Homework 1: Data Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Goals of this homework:***\n",
    "Onboard into the course (introductions and short video), perform end-to-end data analysis on a noisy real-world dataset (ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis), practice clear technical communication (written and spoken via short video), and answer interview-style questions that assess data reasoning, assumptions, tradeoffs, and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Submission instructions:***\n",
    "\n",
    "You should post your notebook to Canvas (look for the homework 1 assignment there). Please name your submission **your-uin_hw1.ipynb**, so for example, my submission would be something like **555001234_hw1.ipynb**. Your notebook should be fully executed when you submit ... so run all the cells for us so we can see the output, then submit that.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Grading philosophy:***\n",
    "\n",
    "We are grading reasoning, judgment, and clarity, not just correctness. Show us that you understand the data, the constraints, and the limits of your conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "***For each question, you need to respond with 3 cells:***\n",
    "1. **[A Code Cell] Your Code:** If code is not applicable, put `# no code` in the cell. For tests: tests can be simple assertions or checks (e.g., using `assert` or `print` or small functions or visual inspection); formal testing frameworks are not required.\n",
    "2. **[A Markdown Cell] Your Answer:** Write up your answers and explain them in complete sentences. Include any videos in this section as well; for videos, upload them to your TAMU Google Drive, and ensure they are set to be visible by the instruction team (`caverlee@tamu.edu` and `mariateleki@tamu.edu`), then share the link to the video in the cell.\n",
    "3. **[A Markdown Cell] Your Resources:** You need to cite 3 types of resources and note how they helped you: (1) Collaborators, (2) Web Sources (e.g. StackOverflow), and (3) AI Tools (you must also describe how you prompted, but we do not require any links to any specific chats). Specifically, use the following format as a template:\n",
    "```\n",
    "On my honor, I declare the following resources:\n",
    "1. Collaborators:\n",
    "- Sam Altman (indirectly)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Web Sources:\n",
    "- https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/index.html (just for general python things like lower() and strip())\n",
    "- https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/ (just for pandas stuff, creating a dataframe, dropping rows, apply(), etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. AI Tools:\n",
    "- ChatGPT 5.2 - helped with runtime errors: read_csv not working because of extra columns in some rows, data type coercion issues for latitude / longitude, wrote test cases for part 1, wrote the regex for part 3, clarified and wrote code for the contingency table problem in part 4, helped create the graphs in part 4, \n",
    "```\n",
    "***Why do we require this cell?*** This cell is important...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For academic integrity, you must give credit where credit is due.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We want you to pay attention to how you can successfully get help to move through problems! Is there someone you work with or an AI tool that helps you learn the material better? That's great! The point of engineering is to use your tools to solve hard problems, and part of graduate school is learning about how *you* learn and solve problems best.\n",
    "\n",
    "***A reminder: you get out of it what you put into it.***\n",
    "Do your best on these homeworks, show us your creativity, and ask for help when you need it -- good luck!"

This indicates the data quality is very poor, if this data was pulled from an automated data storage system, like a SQL database, then it would not make sense for there to be extra columns for some rows and not others (SQL would not allow this nonsense). This points to the data being manually collected and recorded, and this is not a good way to collect / store data since people make mistakes.\n",
    "2. There were many different formats for the duration (hours / minutes) again indicating poor data quality since it was manually collected / entered. This also makes it very painful for analysis since you have to identify all of the different possible regex patterns used by reporters to report the duration\n",
    "3. In general, the data is quite skewed. The sighting frequency tends to skew towards years that are closer to the present, and California has the largest number of sightings by a large margin (about double the number of sightings that the next contender, Washington, has). Although when we adjust for population size, Washington has the highest number of sightings per capita, again by a pretty wide margin. I think it's also interesting that the two states with the highest sighting frequencies are located on the west coast. "

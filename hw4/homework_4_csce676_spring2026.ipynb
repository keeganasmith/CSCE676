    "***Goals of this homework:***\n",
    "Perform an analysis of a graph of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Submission instructions:***\n",
    "\n",
    "You should post your notebook to Canvas (look for the assignment there). Please name your submission **your-uin_hw3.ipynb**, so for example, my submission would be something like **555001234_hw3.ipynb**. Your notebook should be fully executed when you submit ... so run all the cells for us so we can see the output, then submit that.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Grading philosophy:***\n",
    "\n",
    "We are grading reasoning, judgment, and clarity, not just correctness. Show us that you understand the data, the constraints, and the limits of your conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "***For each question, you need to respond with 2 cells:***\n",
    "1. **[A Code Cell] Your Code:**\n",
    "  - If code is not applicable for the question, you can skip this cell.\n",
    "  - For tests: tests can be simple assertions or checks (e.g., using `assert` or `print` or small functions or visual inspection); formal testing frameworks are not required.\n",
    "2. **[A Markdown Cell] Your Answer:** Write up your answers and explain them in complete sentences. Include any videos in this section as well; for videos, upload them to your TAMU Google Drive, and ensure they are set to be visible by the instruction team (set to: **anyone with a TAMU email can view**), then share the link to the video in the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "***At the end of each Section (A/B/C/...) include a cell for your resources:***\n",
    "\n",
    "**[A Markdown Cell] Your Resources:** You need to cite 3 types of resources and note how they helped you: (1) Collaborators, (2) Web Sources (e.g. StackOverflow), and (3) AI Tools (you must also describe how you prompted, but we do not require any links to any specific chats). Specifically, use the following format as a template:\n",
    "```\n",
    "On my honor, I declare the following resources:\n",
    "1. Collaborators:\n",
    "- Reveille A.: Helped me understand that a df in pandas is a data structure kinda like a CSV.\n",
    "- Sully A.: Helped me fix a bug with the vector addition of 2 columns.\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Web Sources:\n",
    "- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46562479/python-pandas-data-frame-creation: how to create a pd df\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "3. AI Tools:\n",
    "- ChatGPT: I gave it the homework .ipynb file and the ufo.csv, and told it to generate the code for the first question, but it did it with csv.reader(), so I re-prompted it to use pandas and that one was correct\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "***Why do we require this cell?*** This cell is important...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For academic integrity, you must give credit where credit is due.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We want you to pay attention to how you can successfully get help to move through problems! Is there someone you work with or an AI tool that helps you learn the material better? That's great! The point of engineering is to use your tools to solve hard problems, and part of graduate school is learning about how *you* learn and solve problems best.\n",
    "\n",
    "***A reminder: you get out of it what you put into it.***\n",
    "Do your best on these homeworks, show us your creativity, and ask for help when you need it -- good luck!"

    "## Overview\n",
    "In this homework, you will **choose one dataset you like** from the [SNAP datasets](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html) collection from the **Social networks** section. You must choose a  **directed graph only**. In this section, you will perform a step‑by‑step data mining & experimental analysis. *Much of this section is self-directed, meaning you will need to make critical decisions about what tools you use and what you explore.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, you should eventually turn in a coherent story: **What you tried → Why → What you found → So what? → Wait...Anything more?**. It's completely OKAY if you only get minor discoveries. But you should always document the whole learning and reasoning process. Grading will be based on the logic and coherence of your submitted notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a guide, for each step of the homework, you should briefly document:\n",
    "- **Method choice & rationale.** Why this method? What do you expect?\n",
    "- **Parameters.** E.g., `alpha=0.85` for PageRank; seed selection for PPR; thresholds for community extraction.\n",
    "- **Results.** Tables/plots + **1–3 sentences** of interpretation.\n",
    "- **Reflection.** Did results match your expectations? If not, why might that be?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, strong submissions should read like a *short research memo* rather than a raw dump of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "You may use **Python 3.9+**. Other possible tools are:\n",
    "- **Graph tools**: You are welcome to use existing tools that are optimised for graph learning. Among them, `networkx`is recommended. `graph-tool` and `igraph` are also good when dealing with larger graphs.\n",
    "- **Data processing packages**: eg. `numpy`, `pandas`\n",
    "- **Plotting**: `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `seaborn` etc.\n",
    "- **other related tools** `scipy`, `scikit-learn`,  `pytorch` etc.\n",
    "- You may choose other tools; just be sure to let us know.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If your chosen dataset is very large, consider using `graph-tool` and `igraph`, or sampling/induced subgraphs to stay within reasonable time/memory limits.\n"
